                                                             SUMMARY 
South Vietnam has all kinds of topography like those in North and central 
Vietnam: mountains, forests, highlands delta and islands. However, the 
majority is located in the delta with various flows. This fact is reflected in 
the toponyms of South Vietnam. 
The diallect consists of two arrays. The first arry includes the topograhical 
names such as: Bung, roundabouts, marsher, swamps,…the second arry is 
composed of words indicating flows: diches, canals, hóc, rỏng,… 
The topographical words related to the South waters are quite diverse. These 
words have enriched the Vietnamese vocabulary, complemented our nation‘s 
vocabulary. This is the considerable contribution of the Southern dialect.
